To create the project I used [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/), because of the practicality. In addition, I chose to use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) as the development library. In this way, I did all the styling with [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). I managed the routes through the [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/). For the project's commit pattern, I used the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
